# Free Recipes

This repository features a React-based application that allows the user access to free meal and drink recipes. 

* The first view presented to the user will be two radio options for meal or drink, and a search bar. 

* The user will enter a search word, i.e, pasta, chocolate, cocktail, and hit the search button. 

* The search terms will be sent to an API and if there are results, they will be presented to the user. 

* If there are no results, the user will be notified to try again.
