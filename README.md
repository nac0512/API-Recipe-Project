# Anyone Can Cook Free Recipes API Project

This repository features a React-based application that allows the user access to free meal and drink recipes. This project is for **demonstration purposes only**.

* The first view presented to the user will be two radio options for meal or drink, and a search bar. 

* The user will select a recipe type, enter a search word, i.e, pasta, chocolate, cocktail, and hit the search button. 

* The search terms will be sent to an API and if there are results, they will be presented to the user in the form of a thumbnail and title list. 

* To see more information about a specific recipe, the user must click on the desired thumbnail. 

* If there are no results, the user will be notified to try again.
